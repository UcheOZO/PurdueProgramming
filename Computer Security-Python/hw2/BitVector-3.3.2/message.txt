Beyond question, computer and network security has emerged as one of
the most important subjects of study in modern times. Even the minutest
details of our lives now depend on our computers and networks working
with our trust that the information that is private to us will not fall
in the hands of those with ill intent. The two major components of
computer and network security are cryptography and what is known as
systems-oriented security. For a good education in computer and network
security, you have no choice but to learn them both. That, then, is the
goal of this course: To provide a balanced introduction to both cryptography
and the systems-oriented issues. The systems-oriented issues we will cover
in this course include Denial-of-Service attacks, DNS Cache Poisoning attacks,
Buffer Overflow attacks, Dictionary attacks, attacks with viruses, worms, and
Trojans, etc.
