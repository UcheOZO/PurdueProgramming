Sorting algorithm implementation

In this project I implemented two sorting algorithms-
1) Shell Sort- an improvement of insertion sort. It swaps itms over large distances
2) Cocktail Sort- an improvement of bubble sort. It is different form bubble sort in that it sorts item both ways, i.e., going from left to right and comng back from right to left.

Execution command-
compile:  gcc -Wall -Werror -O3 sorting.c sorting_main.c -o proj1
run: proj1
