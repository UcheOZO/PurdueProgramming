In this project I implemented the Huffman Compression and Decompression, using the concept of Huffman Coding. The project extensively uses the binary tree data structure to implement the concept

Flags used and testing info for compilation and running the program:-
•	Please use the -lm flag for compiling huff.c
•	huff.c takes one input, which is the input file name
•	unhuff.c also takes one input, which is the input file name
